# Coding Style Guide

## The following Coding Style Conventions were formulated and agreed to by all team members;

1. The "camel case" style (eg. userStory) is to be used on all code by all team members on names of variables, functions, et cetra. 

2. VS Code formating will be applied through out the project. Use a linting vscode extension to do automatic code linting/formatting,

3. Team members are to write code that is self explanatory. Thus, minimising commenting.

4. Capital letters are to be used for constants and global variables
